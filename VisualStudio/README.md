## Windows Build Instructions

0. After cloning this project (or downloading/unzipping/dragging it, then opening **Command Prompt**),\
   `cd` to the project's directory, which is assumed to appear as `.\` as below.

1. Download the latest **Vulkan SDK**: &nbsp; https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows \
   Run the `.exe` and when requested, either: a) change the Install directory as follows,\
   **The HelloVulkanSDL Visual Studio project will be looking for: &nbsp; `.\External\VulkanSDK`**\
   -OR- b) Install the SDK to wherever you want, requiring you to run the script in #3 below.
2. Download the DEVELOPMENT LIBRARIES for both of these:\
  a) **SDL:** &nbsp; https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php \
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; You're probably running 64-bit Windows, so download: &nbsp; `SDL2-devel-2.0.<xx>-VC.zip`\
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (where "\<xx>" is the latest version number)\
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (DON'T bother with the "Runtime Binaries" -- they're just DLLs, lacking the .H files we need)\
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Unzip and drag to either `.\External` or your own location like #1b) above.\
  b) **SDL_image:** &nbsp; https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ \
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Similar to above, you'll probably want to download: &nbsp; `SDL2_image-devel-2.0.<x>-VC.zip`\
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ("\<x>" is latest)\
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; and unzip it the same way.

3. To set up symbolic links (skip this if you installed everything to the `.\External` directory),\
   edit and run the `setup1st.bat` script* as follows. &nbsp; From **Command Prompt**:
	1. `cd` to where you downloaded/cloned, then into the **`VisualStudio`** directory.
	2. Make sure you have the relative path correct: `dir ..\..\<to directory where you downloaded #1 & #2 above>` 
	3. `notepad setup1st.bat` and replace the `EXTERNAL_LIBRARY_PATH`'s value with the one you just saw.\
	   Also examine the SDK and SDL version numbers &ndash; which are part of the filenames/directory-names you
	   downloaded and extracted &ndash; to make sure those in the script are up-to-date and match exactly.  Save and exit.
	4. Run the batch file:  `.\setup1st.bat`
	5. Verify `External` directory created in project root and that its junction links list actual files/dirs.

4. Ensure `build` directory has symbolic links **(skip this if you just ran the `setup1st.bat` file in #3.iv. above)**.\
   The running `.exe` expects to find `compiledShaders` and `textures` subdirectories in its same working directory.\
   These are set up as links at install time (right now) to avoid redundantly copying big files every build.\
   If this was not done via `setup1st.bat` or it failed, refer to
   [Build Directory](https://github.com/electromaggot/HelloVulkanSDL/edit/master/VisualStudio#build-directory) below.

5. Open `VisualStudio\HelloVulkanSDL.sln`, build, and run.\
	To try different demos, change the `iMode` variable atop the `HelloApplication::Init()` method in the `HelloTriangle.cpp` file.

<br/>

\* - If, for whatever reason, the setup script fails to work, here's how to manually replicate its setup of the `External` directory.\
FOR BUILD PROCESS TO FIND:
1. VulkanSDK:\
	`> cd .\External`<br/>
	`> mklink /J VulkanSDK <path\to\where\you\installed\sdk>`<br/>
	Example from my machine:  `mklink /J VulkanSDK ..\..\Modules\3rdParty\VulkanSDK`
2. SDL:\
	Link this unzipped library like #1 above:\
	`> mklink /J SDL2-2.0.<xx> <path\to\where\you\installed\sdl2>`\
	Example from my machine:  `mklink /J SDL2-2.0.10 ..\..\Modules\3rdParty\SDL2-2.0.10`
3. SDL_image:\
	Link this the same way as #2 above.\
	Example:  `mklink /J SDL2_image-2.0.5 ..\..\Modules\3rdParty\SDL2_image-2.0.5`
