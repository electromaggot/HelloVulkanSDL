NOTES
1. These files are only intended to be included in Xcode projects.
2. The function vkEnumerateInstanceVersion(uint32_t* pApiVersion)
  although prototyped in vulkan_core.h, fails to link when called,
  because it doesn't seem implemented in the MoltenVK libraries.
  So an "implementation" is provided here, which links, and tries
  vkGetInstanceProcAddr() to locate the function, returning error
  on failure.
   If vkEnumerateInstanceVersion is also unavailable on other
  platforms, consider moving this file into the common "src"
  directory, unless it has been deprecated entirely, delete it.
