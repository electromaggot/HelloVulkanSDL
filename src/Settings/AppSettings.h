// To encapsulate:  (design/needs/choices such as:)
//	- "Delivery" of universal (app-wide) values that may be needed anywhere.
//	- Security (risk of someone changing) vs. ease-of-access/speed-of-access.
//	- Persist of Attributes:
//	  - First of all, should settings persist? or always assume default values.
//	  - How?  File or hard-coded (testing) data or over network/cloud (*).
//	  - Format?  JSON (probably ever "only choice" but in theory, encapsulated).
//	  - Specific choice of which JSON Parser (i.e. if we decide to go with
//		a different one later, only this class is impacted).
//	  - Encryption layer possible (for e.g. a password).
//	  - (*) - Specific HTTP library chosen.
// There must be strong differentiation between Platform variables and App settings.
//	The latter may include default values that are app-arbitrary, but the former
//	are operational.  However, this class can still be used to "deliver" those.
// Interfaces with either File or Network (HTTP) component to abstract
//	destination for storage/retrieval.
