// Represent a Vertex Array by an abstract Descriptor of vertex type,
//	a pointer to all the vertices, and the number of them.
// To keep the vertex array's initialization as simple as possible, while
//	its individual vertices are typed, their structure must be trivial/
//	plain-old-data, and especially, not inherited, like from an abstraction.
//	So unfortunately, the so-called "abstract type" has to be a void pointer.
