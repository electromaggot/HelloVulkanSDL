//	- dedicated GPU (vs. integrated)
//	- support for graphics and present operations
//	- availability of desired device extensions
//	- larger VRAM
//	- higher-end or newer model (hard to determine?)
//	(other options: higher-performance/faster, greater extension support)

// Scores are tallied in successive passes, according to an array --in order of importance-- of
//	functions that return "raw" scores.  Those can be compared against each other, for the current
//	pass, to form a "normalized" score suitable for comparison across passes... which is then
//	added into each device's total.  Presently, the total is multiplied each pass (to maintain
//	the aforementioned order-of-importance) by the maximum normalized value.  This approach keeps
//	the significance of each pass distinct, but a smaller multiplier could be used to "blend" it.
//	The rationale to this scoring algorithm is further discussed in the Developer Notes.
