	//TJ_LATER_DEV_NOTE:
	// Having extracted the Framebuffer reference from Swapchain*,
	//	where it didn't really belong (and perhaps I reached to avoid...),
	//	it now adds yet another dependency to CommandObjects construction.
	// That's SIX dependencies, nearly all of our member Vulkan objects!
	//	(later edit: now FIVE, perhaps making this paragraph more moot.)
	// It seems ugly/smelly.  If I'm going to have this many dependencies
	//	passed, I may as well just pass the VulkanSetup object itself as
	//	a single dependency of CommandObjects!  (If it's a child of this
	//	class, that would be a circular dependency, so it's not as easy.)
	// So I'd like to reconsider this design, although it builds & works
	//	for now; I'm checking it in as a progress ledge with this comment.

	// * - I had originally thought that Framebuffer should be a child
	//	object of Swapchain.  I'm not sure what the cleanest way to do it
	//	is... however, my current setup seems monolithic and it would be
	//	nice to have a bit more depth to what should be more hierarchical.
	// The number of Framebuffers depends on (matches) the number of
	//	Swapchain imageViews, which is determined by a runtime call to
	//	vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR().  Thus ImageViews is indeed a
	//	dependency of Framebuffers... which also requires Swapchain's Extent.
	// Initializing the ImageViews could be done earlier in
	//	an initializer list chain.  For instance, Swapchain could construct...
	//	Actually, not really possible in a clean RAII fashion (avoiding
	//	news/deletes for instance)... and Swapchain, by recognizable name,
	//	must be a top-level object.  Also Framebuffers need RenderPass while
	//	Swapchain doesn't, so this would be a pure, polluting pass-through.

	// createSwapchain depends on: (device/surface, queueFamilyIndices behind scenes)
	//		does come up with its own nImages (has logic (method) for this,
	//				based on what vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities returns)
	//		calculates extent (if not specified by Capabilities (above), gleans
	//							from surface, clamped to limits)
	//  - so basically, not dependent on much, must construct first
	// createImageViews depends on: (device)
	//	- Swapchain (used in call to vkGetSwapchainImages)
	//		get nImages from this call, loops to init its array
	// createFramebuffers depends on: (besides device)
	//	- ImageViews (child of Swapchain)	\
	//	- Swapchain.extent					 > So: Swapchain, RenderPass
	//	- RenderPass						/
	//
	// VERDICT: I guess it seems most clean to keep ImageViews a child of
	//	Swapchain, and keep Framebuffers separate, as it is right now.
	//	This means the only remaining ugliness would be all the parameters
	//	passed to CommandObjects, which I'd like to rework anyway, especially
	//	to get rid of the "prepareForMainLoop" pointers in HelloTriangle.cpp,
	//	which still seem quite klunky.
	//	GOAL: Replace all the pointers assigned in "prepareForMainLoop" with
	//	more-clean, initializer-list-assigned references, replacing those at
	//	the top of application::drawFrame().
	//		SUBGOAL: replace application::Init().initialShaders instead with
	//		a constructor, that initializes same, which could be supplanted
	//		with another object to subsequently init follow-on shaders.

	//TJ_ANOTHER_NOTE
	// Here are some "general rules" I'd like to establish explicitly and
	//	try to follow, for this entire project:
	//		1. VulkanModule object constructors get passed other alread-
	//			constructed VulkanModule objects that they depend on.
	//		2. Each constructor then calls a "create..." method.
	//		3. ::create...() methods should only be allowed to receive
	//			Vulkan's native "VkObjects" (not VulkanModule objects),
	//			so that their exact dependencies are EXPLICIT.
	// As a general rule, ALL objects depend on VkDevice, also for
	//	destruction, so its reference is saved and handled differently,
	//	not necessarily being passed to ::create...().
	//

/*TJ: (delete later)
	This was 15_hello_triangle's (Vulkan-Tutorial's) order of initialization, FYI:

	void HelloTriangleApplication::run() {
		initWindow();
		initVulkan();
		mainLoop();
		cleanup();
	}

	void HelloTriangleApplication::initVulkan() {
		createInstance();
		setupDebugMessenger();
		createSurface();
		pickPhysicalDevice();
		createLogicalDevice();
		createSwapChain();
		createImageViews();
		createRenderPass();
		createGraphicsPipeline();
		createFramebuffers();
		createCommandPool();
		createCommandBuffers();
		//i.e.: void createCommandBuffers(std::vector<VkFramebuffer> swapChainFramebuffers, VkExtent2D swapChainExtent);
		createSyncObjects();
	}

 	Using C calls to flat C methods, despite looking straight-forward
 	above, it quickly devolved into a mega morass of monolithic C.
